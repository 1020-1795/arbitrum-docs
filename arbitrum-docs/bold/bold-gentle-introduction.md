# A gentle introduction: Bounded Liquidity Delay (BOLD) challenge protocol

import PublicPreviewBannerPartial from './partials/_bold-public-preview-banner-partial.md';

<PublicPreviewBannerPartial />

This introduction is for those who want to learn about BOLD: a new challenge protocol for optimistic rollups that can enable **permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains**. BOLD stands for Bounded Liuqidity Delay and is currently deployed on a public testnet. 

BOLD will eventually replace the current fraud proof mechanism that powers Arbitrum chains today.

### In a nutshell:
- BOLD is a new challenge protocol that enables any party to challenge incorrect state transitions on Arbitrum chains in a permissionless manner, eventually replacing Arbitrum's current fraud proof mechanism.
- The goal of BOLD is to confirm data known as **assertions** that correspond to the history of an Arbitrum chain.
