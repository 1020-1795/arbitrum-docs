## Enumeration Members

### CREATION\_FAILED

• **CREATION\_FAILED** = ``2``

An attempt was made to create the retryable ticket, but it failed.
This could be due to not enough submission cost being paid by the L1 transaction

#### Defined in

[src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts:52](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/4d1c5a4e2/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L52)

### EXPIRED

The message has either expired or has been canceled. It can no longer be redeemed.

#### Defined in

___

### FUNDS\_DEPOSITED\_ON\_L2

• **FUNDS\_DEPOSITED\_ON\_L2** = ``3``

The retryable ticket has been created but has not been redeemed. This could be due to the
auto redeem failing, or if the params (max l2 gas price) * (max l2 gas) = 0 then no auto
redeem tx is ever issued. An auto redeem is also never issued for ETH deposits.
A manual redeem is now required.
